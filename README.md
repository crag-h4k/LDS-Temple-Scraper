### Context
I couldn't find a data set about LDS temples, so I wrote a script to scrape lds.org and save the data as a CSV. Enjoy!

### Content
Temple name, location, dedication date(some dates include "announced", these temples haven't been completed)

### Libraries and Frameworks
Pandas - make dataframe and clean data
UnicodeData - normalize raw characters
Selenium - webdriver and data acquisition
